This is a neural network designed to tackle the hello-world quivalent problem in the field of Machine Learning, the handwritten digits recognition problem.

The code is based on [network.py](https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning/blob/master/src/network.py) from the free online textbook [*Neural Networks and Deep Learning*](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html), by [Michael Nielsen](http://michaelnielsen.org/).

The neural network implements some of the most commonly used and important concepts and techniques in machine learning, including momentum-based stochastic gradient descent algorithm, fully matrix-based backpropagation method, L2 and dropout regularisation, variable learning rate and several cost and activation functions.  
This is a work in progress.
